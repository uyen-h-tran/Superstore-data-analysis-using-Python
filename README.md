In this project, I will use **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, GeoPandas)** to analyze the sales and profit data of a retailer, Superstore. The goal of this project is to help Superstore understand what works best for them and what they should improve or change. The following key questions will be answered:

**1. What are the sales trends over time?**
**2. How do sales and profit vary across categories, regions, and customer segments?**
**3. Which profitable and unprofitable products should Superstore keep or remove from its portfolio?**
